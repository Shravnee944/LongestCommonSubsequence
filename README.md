Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence problem in Java.

Instructions to Run
1. Compile the code using:
   
   javac LongestCommonSubsequence.java

2. Run the program using:


   java LongestCommonSubsequence

Example Input/Output
Input Strings: "AGGTAB", "GXTXAYB"
Output: LCS = "GTAB", Length = 4
